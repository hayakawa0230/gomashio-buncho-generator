## How to play
- Just open `index.html` in a browser (no dependencies).
- Mission 1: Use the slider to set black/white ratio, press and hold on the canvas to charge power, release to sprinkle. After 5 sprinkles you move on.
- Mission 2: Drag the circular mask to move it; resize with the bottom-right handle.
- Mission 3: Check the result, then click “画像を保存” to download the PNG. “最初から” restarts.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Markup and font loading.
- `styles.css` — Layout and responsive styling.
- `main.js` — Particle physics, stage management, crop/save logic.
